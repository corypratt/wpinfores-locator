wpinfores-locator
=================
The beginnins of a Wordpress plugin design to ease the integration of Infore's product locator service with a wordpress site.

Right now it simply uses the groups you provided to IRI for searching.  Please note, developent is early and has been built for
a specific use case.  I'd welcome any branching.


Instructions:

1.	Download and install the plugin
2.	Go to Settings > Infores Locator
3.	Enter your Client ID and Product Family ID and save
4.	On your locator page, simply use the shortcode [infores]
